    "# 📘 Introduction to Python Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **lists** are useful for storing multiple items in a single variable. However, they don’t associate values with meaningful keys. For example, suppose we are working with biomedical data. We might have one list containing the **names of patients** and another list containing their **systolic blood pressure values**, both ordered in the same sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to retrieve a patient's blood pressure, we must loop through both lists simultaneously using the `zip()` function. This approach can quickly become inefficient and hard to manage—especially when dealing with more than two attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧬 Why Use Dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "While handling patient data, we often need to manage **multiple attributes** such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name  \n",
    "- Age  \n",
    "- Gender  \n",
    "- Body weight  \n",
    "- Systolic blood pressure  \n",
    "- Diagnosis  \n",
    "- Prescribed drugs  \n",
    "- Co-existing ailments  \n",
    "- Allergies  \n",
    "\n",
    "Managing all of these attributes using only lists becomes complex and error-prone. This is where **Python dictionaries** become incredibly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries allow us to store **key-value pairs**, where each key acts as a descriptive label for its associated value. This structure makes it easy to **access**, **modify**, **add**, or **delete** any attribute as the patient’s treatment progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧾 General Characteristics of a Python Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries are defined using **curly brackets `{}`**.\n",
    "- A dictionary may be **empty** or contain **one or more key-value pairs**.\n",
    "- Each **key** represents an attribute (e.g., `\"age\"`, `\"blood_pressure\"`) and is followed by a **colon `:`** separating it from its corresponding **value**.\n",
    "- Each key-value pair is separated from the next by a **comma `,`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ General Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dictionary = {\n",
    "    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n",
    "    \"key_2\": \"value_2\",\n",
